# Dratewka the Shoemaker
### Language: JavaScript<br/>This is an old game from Atari released in 2008, that I've rewrote using JavaScript as part of my school project.
You can't skip the introduction.  
After intro you can use "V" and then enter to see controls.

The images and sounds I used were provided by my teacher.
