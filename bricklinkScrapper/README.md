#bricklinkScrapper
###Project i've been asked to create in 2023, used for scrapping prices of lego bricks/minifigures from [BrickLink](https://www.bricklink.com/v2/main.page).
After selecting file with list of wanted bricks genereated on [BrickLink](https://www.bricklink.com/v2/main.page), program is fetching data and creating creates an excel report with prices and product photos.

I was asked to create it using BeautifulSoup, because of new server security which blocks bot users it's currently not working properly.
